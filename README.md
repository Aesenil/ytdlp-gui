# ytdlp-gui

A simple video and audio downloader gui using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.
An ffmpeg binary needs to be in `./ffmpeg/bin` to work.
The video or audio is saved in the same directory as the code. 

If there are errors when attempting to download, yt-dlp may need to be updated with `python3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp`
